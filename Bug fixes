Bug: 1
But in crewai>=0.130.0, there is no Agent class in the crewai.agents module. 
The correct class you need to import is likely CrewAgent, 
or potentially Agent directly from the top-level crewai module or another module according to the latest docs of crewai.
changed the crew.agent to crewai in agents.py file
Yes—definitely. Refer to the latest CrewAI docs to see how agents, tasks, and Crews are defined in crewai==0.130.0
